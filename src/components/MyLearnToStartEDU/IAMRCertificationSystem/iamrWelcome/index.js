      </h6>
      <p className='mb-1'>
        In this section of the platform you will be able to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how the certification system works</li>
        <li>Reflect on your development of the specific market-ready skills</li>

      </ul>
      <p className='mb-1'>
        There are two Learn to Start Market-Ready Certifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Market-Ready Certification 1: Competitive Entry Level Employability
        </li>
        <li>
          Market-Ready Certification 2: Competitive Project Management
          Employability/Self-Employment
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each certification consists of specific soft skills that are currently
        in demand by the industries you seek to serve. In order to be
        competitive in these industries, you must prove your value by creating
        specific outcomes in the market and demonstrating proficiency in
        multiple skills. Companies will train you in hard skills, but they
        expect you to come prepared with soft skills. Hard skills can be taught
        through traditional academic means, whereas soft skills must be
        developed through experience; the Learn to Start program facilitates and
        guides students through these experiences.

        skills. If you click on any one of these skills, you will see a
        drop-down menu with four page options.&nbsp;

        Treat the IAMR Certification System as a process that reflects your
        skill development. You do not need to prove every skill at once. You can
        take your time to prove proficiency in each individual skill. You can
        also use the same piece of evidence to prove multiple skills. The
        purpose of this process is to prove your value in the market and make
        you competitive in any industry you enter.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Once certified, you will be able to download your certificate as a PDF
        and a badge will appear in your portfolio illustrating your
        certification status. You will also receive a &ldquo;Verify&rdquo; link
        below your badge. This link will allow you to connect to Novae 360.
        There you will have the opportunity to upload your entire portfolio,
        store your certification in the blockchain and verify your certification
        in the market using the Novae 360 verification software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having your certificate verified is highly recommended. It ensures all
        of your skills have been tested in the real-world and verified by a
        mentor, an employer or through an internship opportunity. Verification
        is a key stage of differentiation for you to claim you are authentically
        &ldquo;Market-Ready&rdquo;.&nbsp;
