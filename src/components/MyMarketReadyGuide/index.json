    "title": "Introduction to Your I Am Market-Ready Page",
    "Properties": "The I Am Market-Ready Page allows you to assess your own development through the lens of the Learn to Start criteria. The Five Pillars are the assessment categories that you will use to prove the results of your empowerment, wellness, and performance journey over the course of your time in the program. You will gather and provide context that demonstrates your development and ability in each of the categories. You will then submit this page for initial assessment from your instructor and then for certification.<br/><br/> This process is meant to go alongside your participation in the program. It will take time, experience, and iteration to get you ready to submit to your instructor. Once you have submitted to your instructor, you will most likely receive feedback to help guide you towards additional development so as to ensure you are ready for certification.<br/><br/> Using the I Am Market Ready page, you will be able to create a compilation of content that speaks to your empowerment, wellness, and performance. You have the ability to add multiple forms of content and tag those components to specify which category they represent."

    "title": "Gathering Your Content",
    "Properties": "As you progress towards your goals and through your time in the program, you will gather content you have created to prove your development as someone who is empowered, has achieved wellness, and can perform in the market. You will tag each piece of content you provide on your I Am Market-Ready page with an empowerment, wellness, and/or performance tag. One piece of content can be tagged more than once. In order to create your page, you must have an understanding of each tag. There are ten categories that make up the Five Pillars and within each is a progression of three tags starting with empowerment, which sets the stage for wellness, and the combination allows you to perform. Each of the categories with their progressions of criteria can be found in the Market-Ready graphic.<br/><br/> Throughout your time in the program, you have been reflecting in your three journals: My LTS Journal, My Wellness Journal, and My Personal Finance Journal. These journal entries represent potential content for your I Am Market-Ready page especially in the areas of Empowerment and Performance. On the I Am Market-Ready Page, you will see that you have the capability of importing individual journal entries. You also have the capability of importing articles that you have published on the platform. Remember, this page will be seen by your instructor and then by The Startup Studio for certification. This will not be public-facing, but will hold some of the same content that you will put on your public-facing portfolio.<br/><br/> Here is a breakdown of the ten categories, along with specific guidance for each category to help you determine the most appropriate content to tag.<br/><br/>",

In the top right-hand corner of your I Am Market-Ready page, you will see a button titled Submit to Instructor. When you have gathered all of your content and tagged each of the Empowerment, Wellness, and Performance categories, you are ready to submit.<br/><br/> Once you have submitted to your instructor, they will evaluate your page according to the guidelines for each category. For each tag, they will determine if you have succeeded or failed at demonstrating the specific form of empowerment, wellness, or performance. If you have succeeded, the tag will be marked “S” and if you still have development you need to experience, the tag will be marked “F.” Your instructor will provide feedback for any tag marked “F” so you have support as you plan on how to continue to grow in this area. As you know from the program, feedback is an essential tool in becoming market-ready. Take it as data and learn from it. Set a new goal for yourself so you feel confident in your next submission."

If you do not succeed in your submission, you will have to wait six months before you will be allowed to submit again. This time period is set to ensure you have taken the feedback seriously and have done the work to be ready for submission."
