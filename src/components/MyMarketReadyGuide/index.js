These journal entries represent potential content for your I Am Market-Ready Page. On the I Am Market-Ready Page, you will see that you have the capability of importing individual journal entries. You also have the capability of importing articles that you have published on the platform. Remember, this page will be seen by your instructor and then by The Startup Studio for certification. This will not be public-facing, but will hold some of the same content that you will put on your public-facing portfolio.<br/><br/> Here is a breakdown of the ten categories, along with specific guidance for each category to help you determine the most appropriate content to tag.<br/><br/>',

    title: 'Submitting Your I Am Market-Ready Page for Instructor Assessment',
    Properties:
      'Submitting your I Am Market-Ready page for instructor assessment is a process. You should feel confident in taking your time to create this page. Through your journals, you are tracking your development so use your growing self-awareness to have an honest conversation with yourself in determining whether you have a page that will meet the expectations for success. In the top right-hand corner of your I Am Market-Ready page, you will see a button titled Submit to Instructor. When you have gathered all of your content and tagged each of the skill categories, you are ready to submit.<br/><br/> Once you have submitted to your instructor, they will evaluate your page according to the guidelines for each category. For each tag, they will determine if you have succeeded or failed at demonstrating proficiency in a specific skill within one of the Five Pillars of Assessment. If you have succeeded, the tag will be marked “S” and if you still have development you need to experience, the tag will be marked “F.” Your instructor will provide feedback for any tag marked “F” so you have support as you plan on how to continue to grow in this area. As you know from the program, feedback is an essential tool in becoming market-ready. Take it as data and learn from it. Set a new goal for yourself so you feel confident in your next submission.'
