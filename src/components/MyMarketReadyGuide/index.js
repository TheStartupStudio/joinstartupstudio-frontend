    title: 'Introduction to Your I Am Market-Ready Page',
    Properties:
      'The I Am Market-Ready Page allows you to assess your own development through the lens of the Learn to Start criteria. The Five Pillars are the assessment categories you will use to prove your mastery of the fifteen skills necessary for you to claim that you are market-ready. You will gather and provide context that demonstrates your development and ability in each of the categories. You will then submit this page for initial assessment from your instructor and then for certification.<br/><br/> This process is meant to go alongside your participation in the program. It will take time, experience, and iteration to get you ready to submit to your instructor. Once you have submitted to your instructor, you will most likely receive feedback to help guide you towards additional development so as to ensure you are ready for certification.<br/><br/> Using the I Am Market-Ready Page, you will be able to create a compilation of content that speaks to your abilities in the areas of time management, design thinking, public speaking, adaptability, learning agility, innovation, project management, self-discipline, risk-taking, influence, proactivity, data analysis and statistics, communication across mediums, conflict management, and technology.. You have the ability to add multiple forms of content and tag those components to specify which category they represent.'

    title: 'The Five Pillars of Assessment',
    Properties: `The Five Pillars of Assessment is the model through which you earn your Learn to Start Certification in Market-Readiness. You use evidence created through your participation in the LTS Program to prove your development and achievement within these pillars. Each of the Five Pillars is composed of two categories of market-readiness. You will demonstrate your market-readiness through the development of fifteen specific skills the market needs you to have in order to perform and add value. <br/> <img src=${fivePillarsImage} class='d-block m-auto' width='300'/> <br/> <br/> There are three levels of the Learn to Start Market-Ready Certification. When you reach level three of the certification, you have proved yourself within each of the Five Pillars of Assessment. <br/> <img src=${fivePillars2Image} class='d-block m-auto' width='300'/> <br/> <br/> Story is your ability to tap into and communicate who you are and your ability to connect with the stories of others. You assess your capacity for story by evaluating your own sense of agency and your ability to use it to connect to others, and by assessing your ability to empathize and connect with others. <br/> <br/> Team is your ability to experience, learn, and understand the power of effective collaboration and leadership. You assess your ability to work on a team by evaluating how effective you are in collaboration with others, and by evaluating your ability to lead in your role and recognize the leadership of others. <br/><br/>Build is your ability to follow an idea through its execution. You assess your ability to build by evaluating your sense of creativity and its use in bringing ideas into reality, and by evaluating your critical thinking skills and how effective you are in seeking solutions to problems.<br/><br/>Pivot is your ability to recognize when it is time to move directions. You assess your ability to pivot by evaluating whether you are using failure as a valuable learning tool as you execute, and by evaluating how you collect and use data to determine your next move.<br/><br/>Pitch is your ability to sell your audience on your value and the value of the outcomes you can produce. You assess your ability to pitch by evaluating how effective you are at communicating your value to a selected audience, and by evaluating how effective you are at communicating your solutions to an audience.<br/><br/>The LTS program is designed to provide you with the guidance and opportunity to prove your market-readiness through the development of fifteen specific skills. These real-world applied skills are the foundation for claiming your achievement of the assessment pillars and thereby confidently pronouncing, “I am market-ready.”`

    title: 'Gathering Your Content',
    Properties:
      'By participating in the program and progressing towards your goals, you will gather content you have created to prove your development towards the three levels of market-readiness. You will tag each piece of content you provide on your I Am Market-Ready Page with a skill tag. One piece of content can be tagged with more than one skill. There are ten categories that make up the Five Pillars, and within each is the specific set of skills you can use to prove your achievement.<br/><br/> For Level One Certification, you will need to tag content for the following five skills: time management, design thinking, public speaking, adaptability, and learning agility.<br/><br/>For Level Two Certification, you will need to tag content for the following ten skills: time management, design thinking, public speaking, adaptability, learning agility, innovation, project management, self-discipline, risk-taking, and influence.<br/><br/>For Level Three Certification, you will need to tag content for the following fifteen skills: time management, design thinking, public speaking, adaptability, learning agility, innovation, project management, self-discipline, risk-taking, influence, proactivity, data analysis and statistics, communication across mediums, conflict management, and technology. At Level Three, you must have at least one tag for each Pillar subcategory (i.e. at least one tag for Story: Agency, one tag for Story: Empathy, one tag for Team: Collaboration, etc.).<br/><br/>Throughout your time in the program, you have been reflecting in your three journals: My LTS Journal, My Wellness Journal, and My Personal Finance Journal. These journal entries represent potential content for your I Am Market-Ready Page. On the I Am Market-Ready Page, you will see that you have the capability of importing individual journal entries. You also have the capability of importing articles that you have published on the platform. Remember, this page will be seen by your instructor and then by The Startup Studio for certification. This will not be public-facing, but will hold some of the same content that you will put on your public-facing portfolio.<br/><br/> Here is a breakdown of the ten categories, along with specific guidance for each category to help you determine the most appropriate content to tag.<br/><br/>',

When you have gathered all of your content and tagged each of the skill categories, you are ready to submit.<br/><br/> Once you have submitted to your instructor, they will evaluate your page according to the guidelines for each category. For each tag, they will determine if you have succeeded or failed at demonstrating proficiency in a specific skill within one of the Five Pillars of Assessment. If you have succeeded, the tag will be marked “S” and if you still have development you need to experience, the tag will be marked “F.” Your instructor will provide feedback for any tag marked “F” so you have support as you plan on how to continue to grow in this area. As you know from the program, feedback is an essential tool in becoming market-ready. Take it as data and learn from it. Set a new goal for yourself so you feel confident in your next submission.'
