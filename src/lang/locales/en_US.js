  'terms.paragraph_49':
    'Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Startup Studio LLC and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.',
  'terms.paragraph_50':
    '(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Startup Studio LLC that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Startup Studio LLC, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.',
  'terms.paragraph_51':
    '(b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Startup Studio LLC should be sent to: Attn: Shuffield Lowman, 1000 Legion Place, Suite 1700, Orlando, FL 32801. After the Notice is received, you and Startup Studio LLC may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Startup Studio LLC do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.',
  'terms.paragraph_52':
    '(c) Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00 USD) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00 USD) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.',
  'terms.paragraph_53':
    '(d) Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration: If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.',
  'terms.paragraph_54':
    '(e) Time Limits. If you or Startup Studio LLC pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.',
  'terms.paragraph_55':
    '(f) Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Startup Studio LLC, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Startup Studio LLC.',
  'terms.paragraph_56':
    '(g) Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and STARTUP STUDIO LLC in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND STARTUP STUDIO LLC WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.',
  'terms.paragraph_57':
    '(h) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.',
  'terms.paragraph_58':
    '(i) Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.',
  'terms.paragraph_59':
    '(j) Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.',
  'terms.paragraph_60':
    '(k) Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or effect any other portion of this Agreement.',
  'terms.paragraph_61':
    '(l) Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Startup Studio LLC.',
  'terms.paragraph_62':
    '(m) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Startup Studio LLC may bring an individual action in small claims court.',
  'terms.paragraph_63':
    '(n) Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.',
  'terms.paragraph_64':
    '(o) Claims Not Subject To Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.',
  'terms.paragraph_65':
    '(p) Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Salt Lake County, Orange County Florida, for such purpose.',
  'terms.paragraph_66.1': '14.7 Governing Law. ',
  'terms.paragraph_66.2':
    'The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of Florida, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.',
  'terms.paragraph_67.1': '14.8 Notice. ',
  'terms.paragraph_67.2':
    'Where Startup Studio LLC requires that you provide an email address to access certain features of Startup Studio LLC LLC Properties, you are responsible for providing Startup Studio LLC with your most current email address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Startup Studio LLC is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Terms, Startup Studio LLC’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Startup Studio LLC at the following address: Attn: Shuffield Lowman, 1000 Legion Place, Suite 1700, Orlando, FL 32801. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Startup Studio LLC by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.',
  'terms.paragraph_68.1': '14.9 Waiver. ',
  'terms.paragraph_68.2':
    'Any waiver or failure by Startup Studio LLC to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.',

  'terms.paragraph_69.2':
    'If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.',
